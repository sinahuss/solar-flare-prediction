        "Space weather events, particularly solar flares, pose significant risks to critical infrastructure on Earth and in space. Organizations like NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center require reliable early warning systems to protect:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Satellite communications and GPS systems** that can be disrupted by solar radiation\n",
        "- **Power grids** vulnerable to geomagnetic storms triggered by solar flares\n",
        "- **Astronauts and aircraft** exposed to increased radiation during solar events\n",
        "- **Radio communications** that can be severely affected by solar activity\n",

        "Current prediction methods rely heavily on human expertise and limited historical patterns, often resulting in missed events or false alarms that can lead to unnecessary protective measures and associated costs.\n",

        "\n",
        "This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of solar flare events (C, M, or X-class) within a 24-hour period based on observable characteristics of sunspot regions. The model will provide:\n",

        "- **Early warning capability** for space weather forecasters\n",
        "- **Automated risk assessment** to supplement human expertise\n",
        "- **Improved accuracy** in flare prediction to reduce false alarms and missed events\n",

        "### Success Criteria\n",
        "\n",
        "The model's success will be measured by:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **High recall for X and M-class flares** (the most dangerous events) to minimize missed warnings\n",
        "- **Balanced precision and recall** to reduce false alarms while maintaining sensitivity\n",
        "- **Practical deployment feasibility** for integration into existing space weather monitoring systems\n",
        "\n",
