    "\n",
    "### Organizational Need\n",
    "\n",
    "Space weather events, particularly solar flares, pose significant risks to critical infrastructure on Earth and in space. Organizations like NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center require reliable early warning systems to protect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Satellite communications and GPS systems\n",
    "- Power grids\n",
    "- Astronauts and aircraft\n",
    "- Radio communications\n",
    "\n",
    "Current prediction methods rely heavily on human expertise and limited historical patterns, which may result in missed events or false alarms. These risks can lead to potentially billions of dollars in economic damage and disruptions to essential services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a data product featuring a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of solar flare events (C, M, or X class) within a 24-hour period based on characteristics of sunspot regions. The model will provide early warning capability for space weather forecasters, and improved accuracy in flare prediction to reduce false alarms and missed events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's success will be measured by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High recall for M and X class flares (the most dangerous events) to minimize missed warnings\n",
    "- Balanced precision and recall to reduce false alarms while maintaining sensitivity\n",
    "- Practical deployment feasibility for integration into existing space weather monitoring systems\n",
    "\n",
    "This predictive capability would enable space weather agencies to provide more reliable warnings, allowing for better preparation and protection of critical infrastructure.\n"

    "- `activity`: A code representing the region's recent growth (1=decay, 2=no change).\n",
    "- `evolution`: Describes the region's evolution over the last 24 hours (1=decay, 2=no growth, 3=growth).\n",
    "- `previous 24 hour flare activity`: A code summarizing prior flare activity (1=none, 2=one M1, 3=>one M1).\n",
    "- `historically-complex`: A flag indicating if the region was ever historically complex (1=Yes, 2=No).\n",
    "- `became complex on this pass`: A flag indicating if the region became complex on its current transit (1=Yes, 2=No).\n",
    "- `area`: A code for the total area of the sunspot group (1=small, 2=large).\n",

    "\n",
    "Before analyzing the input features, we must first understand the distribution of our target variables: `common flares`, `moderate flares`, and `severe flares`. The plots below show the number of 24-hour periods in the dataset that recorded zero, one, two, or more flares of each type.\n",

    "This imbalance has several implications for our machine learning approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Selection:** Traditional accuracy metrics will be misleading due to the dominance of the \"no flare\" class, so there should be higher focus on precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",

    "2. **Sampling Strategy:** We may need to employ techniques like stratified sampling to address the imbalance.\n",

    "\n",

But, after normalizing the data, we can see that they actually produce significantly fewer flares per sunspot region. Therefore, they can be categorized as medium-risk regions.\n",

F class regions also produce the highest amount of X-class (severe) flares when data is normalized.\n"

    "**Deployment Recommendations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immediate Deployment:** Use as a supplementary tool to existing space weather forecasting\n",
    "2. **Alert Thresholds:** Set conservative thresholds to prioritize recall over precision for M/X classes\n",
