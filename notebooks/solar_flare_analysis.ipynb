    "### Organizational Need\n",
    "\n",
    "Space weather events, particularly solar flares, pose significant risks to critical infrastructure on Earth and in space. Organizations like NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center require reliable early warning systems to protect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Satellite communications and GPS systems\n",
    "- Power grids\n",
    "- Astronauts and aircraft\n",
    "- Radio communications\n",
    "\n",
    "Current prediction methods rely heavily on human expertise and limited historical patterns, which may result in missed events or false alarms. These risks can lead to potentially billions of dollars in economic damage and disruptions to essential services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop data product featuring a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of solar flare events (C, M, or X-class) within a 24-hour period based on characteristics of sunspot regions. The model will provide early warning capability for space weather forecasters, and improved accuracy in flare prediction to reduce false alarms and missed events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's success will be measured by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High recall for X and M-class flares** (the most dangerous events) to minimize missed warnings\n",
    "- **Balanced precision and recall** to reduce false alarms while maintaining sensitivity\n",
    "- **Practical deployment feasibility** for integration into existing space weather monitoring systems\n",
    "\n",
    "This predictive capability would enable space weather agencies to provide more reliable warnings, allowing for better preparation and protection of critical infrastructure."

    "**Modified Zurich Class**: This classification system categorizes sunspot groups based on their magnetic complexity and structure. The classes range from simple (A, B, C) to complex (D, E, F, H), with more complex classes generally associated with higher flare probability. Complex magnetic configurations create more opportunities for magnetic reconnection events that trigger solar flares.\n",

Larger spots often indicate stronger magnetic fields and greater potential for energy release through flares. The size categories help quantify the scale of magnetic activity in the region.\n",
    "\n",
