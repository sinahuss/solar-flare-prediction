    "### Organizational Need\n",
    "\n",
    "Space weather events, particularly solar flares, pose significant risks to critical infrastructure on Earth and in space. Organizations like NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center require reliable early warning systems to protect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Satellite communications and GPS systems\n",
    "- Power grids\n",
    "- Astronauts and aircraft\n",
    "- Radio communications\n",
    "\n",
    "Current prediction methods rely heavily on human expertise and limited historical patterns, which may result in missed events or false alarms. These risks can lead to potentially billions of dollars in economic damage and disruptions to essential services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a data product featuring a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of solar flare events (C, M, or X class) within a 24-hour period based on characteristics of sunspot regions. The model will provide early warning capability for space weather forecasters, and improved accuracy in flare prediction to reduce false alarms and missed events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's success will be measured by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High recall for M and X class flares (the most dangerous events) to minimize missed warnings\n",
    "- Balanced precision and recall to reduce false alarms while maintaining sensitivity\n",
    "- Practical deployment feasibility for integration into existing space weather monitoring systems\n",
    "\n",
    "This predictive capability would enable space weather agencies to provide more reliable warnings, allowing for better preparation and protection of critical infrastructure.\n"

    " - `evolution`: Describes the region's evolution over the last 24 hours (1=decay, 2=no growth, 3=growth).\n",
    " - `previous 24 hour flare activity`: A code summarizing prior flare activity (1=none, 2=one M1, 3=>one M1).\n",
    " - `historically-complex`: A flag indicating if the region was ever historically complex (1=Yes, 2=No).\n",

    "\n",
    "Before analyzing the input features, we must first understand the distribution of our target variables: `common flares`, `moderate flares`, and `severe flares`. The plots below show the number of 24-hour periods in the dataset that recorded zero, one, two, or more flares of each type.\n",

    "The visualization reveals a severe class imbalance for our solar flare prediction. Out of all 24-hour periods available, only 15% experienced at least one C-Class event, 5% recorded M-Class events, and 1% showed X-Class events.\n",
    "\n",
    "This imbalance has several implications for our machine learning approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Selection:** Traditional accuracy metrics will be misleading due to the dominance of the \"no flare\" class, so there should be higher focus on precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sampling Strategy:** We may need to employ techniques like stratified sampling to address the imbalance.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Medium-Risk:** D class sunspot regions are interesting because they produce the highest number of total solar flares in the dataset. But, after normalizing the data, we can see that they actually produce significantly fewer flares per sunspot region. Therefore, they can be categorized as medium-risk regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High-Risk:** E class regions are almost guaranteed to produce solar flares, reaching just under 1 C-Class solar flare per instance. F class regions produce a low total amount of solar flares, but adjusting for their lower representation in the dataset, they produce a high number of solar flares per region. F class regions also produce the highest amount of X-class (severe) flares when data is normalized.\n"

    "The correlation heatmap reveals specific patterns in how sunspot characteristics relate to flare production:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strong Positive Predictors:**\n",
    "  - `modified Zurich class` `D`, `E`, and `F`: Complex magnetic configurations increase flare probability\n",
    "  - `spot distribution` and `largest spot size`: Classifications similar to `modified Zurich class` related to compactness and size, respectively\n",
    "  - `area`: Larger sunspot groups are more likely to produce higher-class flares\n",
    "  - `previous 24 hour flare activity`: Recent flare history predicts continued activity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Negative Correlations:**\n",
    "  - `modified Zurich class` `B`, `C`, and `H`: Simple or decayed sunspot regions have reduced flare potential\n",
    "  - `historically-complex` and `became complex on this pass`: Complexity factors have negative correlations, which requires deeper understanding of the dataset and solar physics. The `historically-complex` feature shows negative correlation because most historically-complex regions decay to the H-class, which is highly represented in the dataset. The `became complex on this pass` feature may indicate that it takes longer than 24 hours after a region has become complex for it to produce solar flares.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications for Model Development:**\n",
    "This analysis suggests that the model should prioritize current physical characteristics (`spot distribution`, `largest spot size`, `area`) and `modified Zurich class` `D`, `E`, and `F` over historical complexity indicators. The counterintuitive pattern in historical complexity actually strengthens confidence in our dataset's physical validity, as it captures the realistic evolution of solar active regions from initial development through decay phases."
