    "### Organizational Need\n",
    "\n",
    "Space weather events, particularly solar flares, pose significant risks to critical infrastructure on Earth and in space. Organizations like NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center require reliable early warning systems to protect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Satellite communications and GPS systems\n",
    "- Power grids\n",
    "- Astronauts and aircraft\n",
    "- Radio communications\n",

    "\n",
    "### Project Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a data product featuring a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of solar flare events (C, M, or X-class) within a 24-hour period based on characteristics of sunspot regions. The model will provide early warning capability for space weather forecasters, and improved accuracy in flare prediction to reduce false alarms and missed events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's success will be measured by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High recall for X and M-class flares (the most dangerous events) to minimize missed warnings\n",
    "- Balanced precision and recall to reduce false alarms while maintaining sensitivity\n",
    "- Practical deployment feasibility for integration into existing space weather monitoring systems\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "This imbalance has several implications for our machine learning approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Selection:** Traditional accuracy metrics will be misleading due to the dominance of the \"no flare\" class. We must focus on precision, recall, and F1-score for the minority classes.\n",

    "2. **Sampling Strategy:** We may need to employ techniques like SMOTE, class weights, or stratified sampling to address the imbalance.\n",

    "**Modified Zurich Class:** This classification system categorizes sunspot groups based on their magnetic complexity and structure. The classes range from simple (A, B, C) to complex (D, E, F) then decayed (H), with more complex classes generally associated with higher flare probability. Complex magnetic configurations create more opportunities for magnetic reconnection events that trigger solar flares.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Largest Spot Size:** This feature indicates the maximum size of individual sunspots within a group, measured in millionths of the solar hemisphere. Larger spots often indicate stronger magnetic fields and greater potential for energy release through flares. The size categories help quantify the scale of magnetic activity in the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spot Distribution:** This describes the spatial arrangement of sunspots within a group, ranging from single spots to complex clusters. The distribution pattern reflects the underlying magnetic field structure and can indicate the likelihood of magnetic reconnection events that produce flares.\n",

    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
